          Hello, everyone. My name is <span className="primary-header">Aditya Sarfare</span>, and I am a Software Engineer currently residing in <span className="primary-header">Dublin, Ireland</span>. With over three years of professional experience, I specialize in developing scalable applications using technologies such as Java, SQL, and Angular.js. My career has afforded me the opportunity to work with prominent organizations like Hexaware and Accenture, where I refined my expertise in software development and project management.
            <br />
          I hold a Master's degree in Information Systems and Computing from Dublin Business School, along with a Bachelor's degree in Engineering from Mumbai University. I am deeply passionate about utilizing technology to address complex problems and am consistently seeking opportunities to learn and grow in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.
           <br />
           Beyond coding, I have developed a range of soft skills that complement my technicalÂ abilities.          </p>
